- 15/11 choose topic like induction
- polynomial => solvable (n or n^2)
- undeterministic polynomial = concept solution
- not many problems are NP
- NP complete means reducable in ... if we can solve L2 we can solve L1 via reduction.
- Exercise 2.1: Depth First Search or Breath First Search => they choose DFS and came to conclusion it is polynomial
- 2.2: every NP problem can be expressed as a formula, or as satisfiablity formula. It is powerful an NP complete in NP (?). 
- First line of answer would be in double sat, because 
- 
-   |P1 |P2 |P3 |
- A1| 1 |0  |0  |
- A2| 0 |1  |0  |
