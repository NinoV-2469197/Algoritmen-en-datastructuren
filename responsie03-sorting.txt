- don't need to prove, maybe proof an ivariant with induction , what invariant would we need to prove the invariance
proving every invariant would take to long.
- no fullproof on exam (maybe) but correctness is also important
- E8, invariance and induction, R9, look at the rules and what the rules produces so invariance and induction
